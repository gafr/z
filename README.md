[Plan 9](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/) Acme Inspired Editor, done in Scala.

Used Scala 2.11.6 and Java 1.7.0_67

To build it, go to the root of the source and then,

        sbt assembly

	... and you can just copy the files in dist and put it anywhere you want. For example for me, I put it in $HOME/z .

How to use it is documented in the [Z Help Screen](https://github.com/sandgorgon/z/blob/master/bin/help/main.txt).

The wiki has some guides on usage.
