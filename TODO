# TODO
- move to Akka
- implement Dir [dir] already.
- restructure the editor in preparation for client-server architecture, IPC and plumbing - this will be an entertaining exercise the only consequence of this is that the source will become bigger, and I kinda like having the code this small, what can you do right?

# Notes
Dir [dir]		Set the current or default directory that the z editor itself will assume

# Do we _want_ to do this, really?
- when colors are changed from the app/column tagline, they should stay active (?)
- a way to revert the colors back to the default (?)
