# TODO
- do some code clean-up (ongoing)
- bring back a way to search across columns
- make the b3 action, similar to the acme one where there is a configuration defining regexps and what actions to take (it has to be user extendable)

Dir [dir]		Set the current or default directory that zuma itself will assume

# Do we _want_ to do this, really?
- when colors are changed from the app/column tagline, they should stay active (?)
- a way to revert the colors back to the default (?)
